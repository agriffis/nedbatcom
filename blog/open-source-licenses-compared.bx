<p>I've decided to choose a real license for the software I post on this site,
since responsible readers have asked me what license I use.
I find the array of open source licenses baffling, so I dug up some resources:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting from the big bang,
the Open Source Initiative has a comprehensive list of over 50 different licenses:
<a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/'>The Approved Licenses</a>.
There's no help here choosing one, but at least you can examine them in all their glory.
</li>

<li>The <a href='http://www.openfoundry.org/'>Open Foundry</a> has an
<a href='http://swan.iis.sinica.edu.tw/LicenseWizard/license_wizard.php?Lang=en'>interactive wizard</a>,
and a two-page
<a href='http://swan.iis.sinica.edu.tw/LicenseWizard/OSI_License_compare_v3.0.4EN.pdf'>comparison table</a>.
They consider 16 licenses on eight criteria.
Both are hampered by imperfect English, but they present a lot of useful information.
</li>

<li>Zack Rusin from KDE has a
<a href='http://developer.kde.org/documentation/licensing/licenses_summary.html'>table comparing 15 popular licenses</a>.
</li>

<li>Whittling it down even further, David Wallace Croft
<a href='http://www.croftsoft.com/library/tutorials/opensource/'>compares six licenses on three criteria</a>.
</li>

<li>Finally, a lawyer
<a href='http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=153'>explains the implications of some license choices</a>.
</li>

</ul>

<p>After looking over all this, I'm choosing MIT.  It allows others to do the most with the code I write.
When I put myself in the user's shoes, it's the license I would want to see on code I wanted to use.
