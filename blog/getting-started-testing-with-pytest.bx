<title>Getting Started Testing with pytest</title>
<category>testing</category>
<body>

<p>Next week I am presenting <a pref='text/test3.px'/> at Boston Python
(<a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/266720542/">event page</a>).</p>

<p>This talk has been through a few iterations. In 2011, I gave a
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/23388681/">presentation at Boston Python</a>
about Getting Started Testing, based on the standard library unittest module.  In 2014, I updated it and
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/test0.html">presented it at PyCon</a>.
Now I've updated it again, and will be presenting it at Boston Python.
</p>

<p>The latest edition, <a pref='text/test3.px'/>, uses pytest throughout.  It's
a little long for one evening of talking, but I really wanted to cover the
material in it.  I wanted to touch on not just the mechanics of testing, but the
philosophy and central challenges as well.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are important things I left out, and probably digressions I
could trim, but it'll do.  Thoughts welcome.</p>
